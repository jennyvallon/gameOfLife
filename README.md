# gameOfLife

The game started out as a peer programming and TDD exercise at a retreat. 
Programming in pairs and with TDD methadology was so inspiring that I decided to continue the exercise at home.
I've been picking away at it on and off. 

It is using ES5 prototype inheretence because this is how the exercise started. 
Will refactor to use es6 class keyword when complete. 

Jasmine is the testing framework.

All that is left is finalizing the update algorithms and adding the markup.

I'm particularly excited about this code because the game is super interesting, 
the collaborative activity that surrounded it and the paradigm-shifting lessons I learned from peer programing 
that embody what working at MailChimp is all about.
